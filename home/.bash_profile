# tweak console display
# The argument to __git_ps1 will be displayed only if you
# are currently in a git repository.  The %s token will be
# the name of the current branch.

# In addition, if you set GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE to a nonempty
# value, unstaged (*) and staged (+) changes will be shown next
# to the branch name.  You can configure this per-repository
# with the bash.showDirtyState variable, which defaults to true
# once GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE is enabled.

# You can also see if currently something is stashed, by setting
# GIT_PS1_SHOWSTASHSTATE to a nonempty value. If something is stashed,
# then a '$' will be shown next to the branch name.

# If you would like to see if there're untracked files, then you can
# set GIT_PS1_SHOWUNTRACKEDFILES to a nonempty value. If there're
# untracked files, then a '%' will be shown next to the branch name.

# If you would like to see the difference between HEAD and its
# upstream, set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM="auto".  A "<" indicates
# you are behind, ">" indicates you are ahead, and "<>"
# indicates you have diverged.  You can further control
# behaviour by setting GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM to a space-separated
# list of values:
#     verbose       show number of commits ahead/behind (+/-) upstream
#     legacy        don't use the '--count' option available in recent
#                   versions of git-rev-list
#     git           always compare HEAD to @{upstream}
#     svn           always compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
# By default, __git_ps1 will compare HEAD to your SVN upstream
# if it can find one, or @{upstream} otherwise.  Once you have
# set GIT_PS1_SHOWUPSTREAM, you can override it on a
# per-repository basis by setting the bash.showUpstream config
# variable.
